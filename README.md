# Read Me -- Ascendiam
This site exists because I'm a professional product manager and I like to write code, too.
<p>I own Ascendiam.com and trademark (TM) the name.</p>
<p>I want to thank <a href="http://www.Bootstrap.com">Bootstrap.com</a> for making a great front end rapid development framework for responsive and mobile first sites, and <a href="http://www.Cloudflare.com">Cloudflare.com</a> for giving me access to an integrated cloud platform and content delivery network (necessary for full screen video and more), and <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> and its open source community of developers who explained how to make things work when documentation didn't seem to. You helped me bring v0.1 of this site to life and saved me hours of effort, and frustration too.
</p>
<p>Now, don't go changing. I'll need your help in the future.

# Ascendiam
This site exists because product managers deserve to have fun writing code too.
I own Ascendiam.com and trademark (TM) the name.
Much thanks to Gary Simon for his <a href="https://coursetro.com/posts/code/130/Learn-Bootstrap-4-Final-in-2018-with-our-Free-Crash-Course">quick bootstrap refresher course</a>. Thanks also to those who continue to improve Bootstrap and keep its documentation up to date. It helped me to build customizations that I'll use on this site and others.

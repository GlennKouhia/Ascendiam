# Ascendiam
This site exists because product managers deserve to have fun writing code too.
I own Ascendiam.com and trademark (TM) the name.
Much thanks to Gary Simon for his <a href="https://coursetro.com/posts/code/130/Learn-Bootstrap-4-Final-in-2018-with-our-Free-Crash-Course">1 hour bootstrap refresher course</a>. Thanks also to those developers who devote time, energy and expertise to open source projects.
